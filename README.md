# MDD4All.SpecIF.DataProvider.Contracts

![Nuget Package Build](https://github.com/oalt/MDD4All.SpecIF.DataProvider.Contracts/workflows/Nuget%20Package%20Build/badge.svg)

SpecIF data provider contract interfaces and abstract classes for CRUD operations on SpecIF data.

These data providers are implemented to support different data persistence technologies for SpecIF (e.g. file, MongoDB, Enterprise Archietct, Jira etc.)

You can use the data providers to work with SpecIF data directly or by Inversion of Control (IoC) used in an ASP.NET Microservice or Web application.
